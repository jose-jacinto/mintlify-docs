## What are Connections?

Connections are the bridge between Opsmatic and your automation platforms. They allow Opsmatic to monitor, analyze, and provide insights about your workflows across different platforms.

## Supported Platforms

Opsmatic currently supports monitoring for two major automation platforms:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="n8n" icon="n8n" href="/connections/n8n-setup">

  </Card>
  <Card title="Make.com" icon="make" href="/connections/make-setup">
    Track Make.com scenarios and execution analytics
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Connection Types

### Personal Connections

Personal connections are:
- Owned by your individual user account
- Visible only to you (unless shared with organizations)
